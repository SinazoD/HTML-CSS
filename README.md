It is a document that contains text and is very easy to read.
Html is also known as a declarative language, that means it simply declares instructions for eaxample,"This is a paragraph" or "make a line break here”
Html Syntax
Html is all about tags
If you have an opening tag you need to also have a closing tag.
The closing tag is identified by a foward slash.
Inside the opening and closing tags we have what we call a content 
Therefore a set of tags with content in between them is called a markup element
The are some tags that do not have end tags and we call these empty elements ie Br(line break)
A line break does not need a closing tag we do not put anything in between

Html navigation and linking
Html links are also known as hyperlinks, they allow you to navigate from one web page to another or different sections within the same page.
When we want to create a link we use the a element which stands for anchor.
To do this we need a href attribute with a URL enclosed in quotes.
Href stands for hypertext referencing.
The most important attribute of the <a>element is the href attribute which indicates the links destination.
Absolute URL contain the the full web address including the protocol, domain and path.They specify tha exact location of a resource on the internet
Relative URL, are specified in relation to the current pages URL, they only include the path to the resource making their shorter
URLs are often uses within the same Website to link the pages or resources within the site
Html-Working with graphics and images 
When we want to add an image we use the image element which is simply written as img.
We use the following syntax to add an image
<img src= "img.jpg"alt"brown dog" width "400” height "300"
There are four attributes you need to for every image:
The first one is the (src), which tells the browser which image file to load or path to the image
The second one is the (alt),which provides the description of the image. It identifies what is going tk show up if the image can't be found
Lastly, we have the width and the height attributes, which identifies the size of the image
There are four file fomarts commonly used in nowadays, each with it's own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to compressing images:
GIF,SVG,JPG,PNG.
