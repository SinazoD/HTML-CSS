Html Syntax
Html is all about tags
If you have an opening tag you need to also have a closing tag.
The closing tag is identified by a foward slash.
Inside the opening and closing tags we have what we call a content 
Therefore a set of tags with content in between them is called a markup element
The are some tags that do not have end tags and we call these empty elements ie Br(line break)
A line break does not need a closing tag we do not put anything in between
